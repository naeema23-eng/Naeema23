 File Encryptor CLI

A simple and secure command-line tool to encrypt and decrypt files or folders using AES encryption, written in Python. Includes optional Docker support and CI testing with GitHub Actions.

 Features

Encrypt and decrypt files and folders
Secure password-based encryption (PBKDF2 + AES)
Automatic output file naming
Command-line interface with clear logs
Unit and CLI tests with GitHub Actions CI
Docker support for isolated runs

Installation

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/naeema23-eng/Naeema23.git
cd Naeema23
2. Install as a package
pip install .
⚙️ Usage

 Encrypt a file
file-encryptor --encrypt -i data/secret.txt -p yourpassword
 Decrypt a file
file-encryptor --decrypt -i data/secret.txt.enc -p yourpassword
The encrypted/decrypted files will be saved in the same folder by default.

Run with Docker (Optional)

Build Docker image
docker build -t file-encryptor .
Run encryption
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/data" file-encryptor --encrypt -i /data/secret.txt -p yourpassword
Run decryption
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/data" file-encryptor --decrypt -i /data/secret.txt.enc -p yourpassword
 Run Tests

Run all unit and CLI tests:

python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
 CI Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically on each push to run the tests.
 Future Improvements

PyPI publishing
Docker Hub image
Support for more encryption algorithms
